# evaneff Reflection



*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

I followed the design for my recipe database very closely.  Since I was working by
myself, I chose to simplify my original plan and eliminate the food database.


## Project

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

  I searched for answers on the internet, a book, asked a family member, and got
  guidence from Swastik.


## Scrum

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

  I did overestimate the amount of work I could get done each week. Since I worked
  on this project on my own, I didn't really get to take advantage of this opportunity
  to estimate my work because I wasn't held accountable to anyone. I did learn it is
  quite a slow process to build something from scratch sometimes troubleshooting can
  take a long time.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

  I was tempted to start my project over with a new idea that was more 
  simple to implement. This felt like it was way to much work for one person. It 
  would have been way more ideal to work in a group, but I do appreciate how much
  I learned from doing everything myself. I now feel like I can say, "Yes, I CAN
  build an API and even a simple front end.

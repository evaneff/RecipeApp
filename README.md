# Learn and Be Curious Project Files

Welcome to your Learn and Be Curious Project Repository! As you already know, Learn and Be Curious is a unique experience from your other sprints here at Bloomtech. The most significant difference is that instead of being given a partially built project with mastery tasks that you need to complete, you will be creating a project from scratch, putting it onto AWS, and presenting your work.


## Problem Statement

There are many websites that allow searching of databases to find the macronutrient content of foods.
Recipe Macro Finder will allow users to create custom recipes and view the total calories and macronutrients of all
the ingredients by serving size.
  
## Use Cases

U1. As a customer, I want to create custom recipes.

U2. As a customer, I want to view all of my saved recipes.

U3. As a customer, I want to update the ingredients in existing recipes.
    
U4. As a customer, I want to update the number of servings in a recipe.

U5. As a customer, I want to view the total calories and macronutrient per serving of a recipe.

U6. As a customer, I want to input custom foods into database.


  
## What Files are in This Repository?

#### [Design Document](project_documents/design_document.md)

The design document is what you need to complete before you start coding. This document lays out what you will be building and how you will build it, and the more you put into it, the easier your implementation will be.

#### [Project Rubric](project_documents/rubric.md)

The rubric contains the requirements for your project. You will fill out the rubric to show that your project successfully covers all the requirements.

#### [Final Presentation Outline](project_documents/final_presentation_outline.pdf)

This outline lays out what we expect to see in your final presentation. The outline is more of a guideline, so feel free to do things in a different order and put your style on your presentation. 

#### [Accomplishment Tracking](project_documents/accomplishment_tracking_template.md)

We encourage you to keep track of your accomplishments throughout your time in Learn and Be Curious. This experience will give you plenty to share during interviews, and having accomplishments written down will help you remember highlights you can share.

#### [Team Charter](project_documents/team_charter.md)

If you are working with a team, you must complete a team charter. This document will establish team norms and expectations, such as how you should communicate your work, how the team will create deadlines, what each person wants to get out of this experience, etc. Building your team charter will help your team work more effectively throughout this project.

#### [Reflection](project_documents/reflection.md)

You will complete your reflection in Canvas, but feel free to see what questions we may ask here.

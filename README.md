# Learn and Be Curious Project Files

Welcome to your Learn and Be Curious Project Repository! As you already know, Learn and Be Curious is a unique experience from your other sprints here at Bloomtech. The most significant difference is that instead of being given a partially built project with mastery tasks that you need to complete, you will be creating a project from scratch, putting it onto AWS, and presenting your work.


## Problem Statement

There are many websites that allow searching of databases to find the macronutrient content of foods.
Recipe Macro Finder will allow users to create custom recipes and view the total calories and macronutrients of all
the ingredients by serving size.
  
## Use Cases

U1. As a customer, I want to create custom recipes.

U2. As a customer, I want to view all of my saved recipes.

U3. As a customer, I want to update the ingredients in existing recipes.
    
U4. As a customer, I want to update the number of servings in a recipe.

U5. As a customer, I want to view the total calories and macronutrient per serving of a recipe.

U6. As a customer, I want to input custom foods into database.

#### [Design Document](project_documents/design_document_final.md)

The design document is what you need to complete before you start coding. This document lays out what you will be building and how you will build it, and the more you put into it, the easier your implementation will be.
